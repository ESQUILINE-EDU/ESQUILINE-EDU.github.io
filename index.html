              <h4> JAMES HERRIOT </h4>
              <p><em> About the Author:-James Albert Wight (3rd October 1916-23rd February 1995), best known by his pen name James Herriot, was a British Veterinary Surgeon and writer. He was famous in writing a series of eight books set in 1930s to 1950s about the animals and their owners and the first publication was in 1970.</em></p>

            <h3 class="resume-title">SUMMARY</h3>
              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5>James Herriot, narrates his experience with Tricki, a dog, one of his patients and his mistress Mrs Pumphrey. As he was passing on the way, he happened to meet Mrs Pumphrey with tricki. He was worried to see Tricki who became fat, like a bloated sausage with leg at each corner. Mrs Pumphrey explained in a hurry that she found him weak with no energy and felt as suffering from loss of nutritious food. So, she began to give extra food to him extra food like some malt, cod-liver oil and a bowl of Horlicks at night to make him sleep. She continued saying that she couldn’t cut sweets from his diet as he likes cream cakes and chocolates. The doctor found that Tricki became greedy was ready to eat a meal at any time of the day. Mrs Pumphrey had given him a little walk and not much exercise was possible. Within few days Mr Herriot received a call from Mrs Pumphrey with a complaint that Tricki lost his interest even in his favourite in his food and a sensation of vomiting began to express. He spent all his time lying on a rug trying to get breath without moving and doing nothing. The doctor decided to get Tricki out of the house to save him and suggested to hospitalise him. Mrs Pumphrey was almost sad that she knew that Tricki can’t survive without seeing her and at the same time she has realised that he would die if the treatment is not given. Mr Herriot who was strongly determined have taken Tricki and walked towards his car. There was an expression of affection that the entire staff with Mrs Pumphrey, began to run with tricki’s day bed, night bed, favourite cushions, toys breakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl and many more things. Mr Herriot realised that there is not having sufficient space for all the stuff in his car and he started it. While moving he found that all of them were in tears and Tricki, sitting by the side, had wagged his tail. Mr Herriot had determined that he would cure the dog.
In the hospital all the other dogs admitted there gathered around but Tricki’s reaction was dull and they left the place considering him uninteresting. Mr Herriot arranged a place for Tricki and for the first two days, he did not give any food to him and allowed to drink plenty of water. By evening of the second day he began to react and on the third day he started to create a painful sound for the sounds of the dogs in the yard. Slowly he began to mingle with other dogs enjoying food and play games. Since then his health began to get improve. 
Mrs Pumphrey kept on getting information about the improvement of Tricki and when she came to know that he is out of danger, she started to bring fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up Tricki’s strength, followed by bottles of wine and brandy. The doctor and his partners had a happy time by consuming them with the egg in the morning, wine in the afternoon and brandy at night around bonfire. The doctor felt to keep the dog for a long time but he has informed Mrs Pumphrey that Tricki is alright and she can pick him from the hospital. In two weeks, he had become a strong muscled animal. When Tricki saw his mistress, he was so excited and jumped over her. Mrs Pumphrey said that it is the success of a doctor over a diseased patient.</h5>

              <h4> Questions and Answers </h4>
              <p> 1 What kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary surgeon is? Would you say he was tactful as well as full of common sense? </p>
<p> Mr Herriot, the narrator was a sensible person who could understand his patients at one stroke. He was tactful because very easily he was able to understand that Tricki is in a dangerous condition. He was a person with full of common sense because he has given his full patience and attention to Tricki to bring him to normal condition.</p>
<p>2   Do you think Tricki was happy to go home? What do you think will happen now?</p>
<p>Yes, Tricki was happy to go home. I think Mrs Pumphrey will understand her mistake of overfeeding to Tricki and take care for not to create same diseased condition for Tricki.</p>
<p>3 Do you think this is a real-life episode or mere fiction? Or is it a mixture of both?</p>
<p>‘A Triumph of Surgery’ is written in first person narration to show it as a real-life experience. It can be a mixture of both where it says that Mrs Pumphrey had sent eatables and alcohol to her pet which were enjoyed by the doctor and his partners. </p>

<h4>Think About It.</h4>

<p>“Griffin was rather a lawless person.” Comment.</p>
<p>Griffin was a brilliant scientist, who had successfully invented the medicine to turn objects with mass to be transparent. He was brilliant in using his intelligence but his behaviour of lawlessness made him to turn into a negative character. The best example is his attitude towards his landlord. His landlord disliked him and tried to eject him. As a part of taking revenge upon him, Griffin set fire to the house and ran away from there. He had removed his clothes to get away without being seen. His act of lawlessness brought him to be without clothes, without money and quite invisible. His abilities and intelligence which could have been used for the prosperity of society and country had become meaningless and a matter of inconvenience for himself because of his lawlessness.</p>
<p>How would you assess Griffin as a Scientist?</p>

<p> 1 Why is Bholi’s father worried about her?</p>
<p>Bholi’s father is worried about her because she had neither good looks nor intelligence as a result that she had fallen off the cot on her head and had damaged some part of her brain and her entire body was permanently disfigured by deep black pock, due to an attack of small-pox.

<p>4 Does she find her teacher different from the people at home?</p>

 <p>Bholi’s teacher played an important role in changing the course of her life as she found her teacher different from the people at home. According to her, teacher’s voice was so soft and soothing and in all her life she had never been called Bholi and the teacher’s attitude touched her heart.</p>
<p>9 Why did Bholi at first agree to an unequal match? Why did she later reject the marriage? What does this tell us about her?</p>
<p>Bholi agreed to an unequal match at first because she wanted to honour and respect her father’s dignity. She later rejected the marriage because Bishember Nath had demanded for five thousand rupees as dowry, when he saw pock-marks on her face. This tells that the education gave the power of self - reliance and courage to Bholi to speak against the injustice that may have taken place towards her and her family. </p>

              <h5>The story Letter to God revolves around the idea of a farmer, having unquestionable faith on God. Lencho the farmer was completely in confidence of God that he may get help from God. It was an unexpected situation that arose in the life of Lencho and his family. They were expecting to have a downpour of rain for a good harvest. The sudden change of wind and hailstorm had completely spoiled their expectations and all their crops. Lencho and family began to look forward for the help from God. Being a hardworking man, like an ox, had decided to write a letter to God. 
The following Sunday morning, Lencho had written a letter to God, saying that he is in need of God’s help. If he and his family will go hungry, unless there comes help from God. He had posted the letter in the post office with an address to ‘GOD”. The post man began to laugh by seeing the address. The postmaster, even though joined the laughter of the post man, suddenly stopped his laughter thinking about the height of Lencho’s faith in God. He had asked all his employees to help to keep the faith of the man up. He asked for money from his employees, he himself gave a part of his salary and several friends of his were obliged to give something for an act of charity. Even though he had tried all his ways to collect money as an act of charity, he couldn’t collect hundred pesos according to the requirement of Lencho. He had inserted all the money that is collected in an envelope, with an address, from ‘GOD’.
The following Sunday Lencho came, in search of a reply from God and the postmaster, with the satisfaction of doing something good for a needy person, handed over the envelope to Lencho. He had opened the envelope and found that there were only seventy pesos. He began to think that God can not do this to him and the postoffice employees might have taken the money from that. He had started to write another letter, mentioning that he hadn’t got enough money so God has to sent remaining also but not through the post office because the people in post office are not trustworthy.

<p>Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?</p>
 Lencho thinks that the employees working in the post office have taken the rest of the money. The irony of the situation is the finger, pointing on those who had tried to help out Lencho that is they have tried to help him but he raised his doubt against them and considered them as crooks.</p>
<p> Was Lencho surprised to find a letter for him with money in it?</p>
 <p>Lencho was not surprised to get the money as he was in strong faith in God.</p>
<p>Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You may select appropriate words from the following list to answer the question. 
<p>Greedy, naïve, stupid, ungrateful, selfish, comical, and unquestioning</p>
 <p>In the real world it is almost impossible to find such people, like Lencho. Lencho seems to be naive and unquestioning. Naïve in the sense that he doesn’t even bother to think about who sent the money or if God would actually send the money. Probably his naiveté comes from his unquestioning belief in the God.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature, and between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?</p>
 <p>The story ‘A Letter to God’ explains the blind faith of a man to God which leads to two types of conflict. In the initial part of the story the episode of rainfall turning into a hailstorm shows the conflict between man and nature. When it is a rainfall, the man is very happy dreaming about prosperous days ahead but once the rain turns into hailstone, his happiness turns to grief. The way Lencho feels sadness and grief, after the storm appropriately projects the conflict of the nature and the man. In the later part of the story, the post master with the help of his employees collected seventy pesos as the possible amount by them, in order to not to shake the faith of Lencho but when Lencho blames post office people for stealing part of the money it turns to the conflict between humans. The post office employees including Post master have been mistaken by Lencho due to his strong faith in God.</p>

              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5>The narrator of the story ‘The Last Lesson’ is Franz, a young school going boy. That morning, he was late for school, and was frightened of being scolded, as the teacher had asked him to learn the rules of participles. He did not know anything at all. For a moment he thought of running away from school and enjoy the warm and bright weather, chirping of birds on the trees and the drill of the Prussian soldiers behind the sawmill. (A mill for cutting wood)
The scene outside was more attractive but he controlled the temptation and chose to attend the school. As he passed the town hall, he noticed a huge crowd. He ignored the bulletin board and the gathering there. As he walked hurriedly towards the school, the blacksmith Wachter called him saying that a lot of time is left with him and no need to be in a hurry to reach school. Franz had taken that as sarcastic as he used to be late always.
The usual scene of the school was a lot of noise and confusion of the opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison very loud and the rapping sound of the teacher’s great ruler. But that day when he reached the school, he felt it as unusual as there was no sound coming out of the school. It seemed as if Sunday morning. Franz tried to enter the classroom without being noticed but it was impossible. In the classroom, he saw that his classmates were seated and the back benches of the class room were occupied by the elders of the village and M. Hamel, his teacher, was walking with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. He got so blushed and frightened but unexpectedly, M Hamel permitted him to enter inside the classroom without scolding. He jumped over the seat and observed the classroom.
He noticed that his teacher had worn his beautiful green coat, his frilled shirt and the little black silk cap, that he wears on inspection and prize days. The whole school seemed strange and solemn (serious) He saw that they all were sad. He was confused and could not figure out, what was happening. Then M Hamel stood up and said that it is their last lesson in French as an order has come from Berlin that French will not be taught and only German will be taught in Alsace and Lorraine, and a German teacher will come to teach them from the very next day. These words of his teacher had fallen as a thunderclap (unexpected shock) in his ears. He realized what was put upon bulletin board.
He regretted for not being serious towards studies and wasting time seeking the bird’s eggs and sliding on the Saar (A river which passes through France). He remembered that he used to consider his books as nuisance (burden). Suddenly he began to feel them as best friends. His attitude towards studies had changed. The news that he would not be able to study French any longer, made him to forget all about the cranky ways and the ruler of his teacher. Now he understood the reason for the special dress of the teacher and the presence of villagers in the class room to express their respect and gratitude to the teacher who served them for the past forty years. 
As he was thinking so the teacher called his name to recite participles. He wanted to recite the lesson at a stretch but he got mixed up and couldn’t recite it. M Hamel said that the teacher, parents and students were responsible for such condition as the students keep on postponing their studies; teacher had given a holiday whenever he wanted to go for fishing and send students for watering the plants and the parents were eager to send their children to farms and mills to earn money. He continued his teaching by saying that French is the most beautiful, clearest and logical language. He added that it is their duty to guard their language. If they permit their language to be alive in their minds, no one can enslave them. Language is a tool to fight domination. Then he taught them Grammar, writing and the necessity to express patriotism through their language, be preserved in their minds. Franz felt everything fancy that his teacher who had taken care of everything in the school, will have to leave the school. He also has felt whether the Prussians force even the pigeons to change their language and sing in German language. Franz felt that the teacher must be heart broken. Just then the clock struck twelve and the angelus (a prayer song) began in the church. The trumpet sounds were heard to indicate the returning of Prussian soldiers. M Hamel stood up to convey that the class got over but became emotional and couldn’t say anything. He just has written “Vive La France!” on board and gestured with his hand to say that the school is dismissed and they may go.

              <h5><p>The narrator of the story implies that spring is the season associated with optimism and hope and in the life span of a human being childhood is the stage associated with optimism and hope. In fact, it is the most beautiful stage in the life of a human being. Spring season evokes a new beginning and hopes but the children described in the narration shows that they have lost hopes about life and the name ‘Lost Spring’ is symbolically given to show that they have lost their childhood. ‘The Lost Spring’ written by Anees Jung talks about the labour that is forced on children, to live a life of poverty and exploitation They don’t live their childhood as they have to carry the burden of poverty and illiteracy.</p>

<p>I – SOMETIMES I FIND A RUPEE IN THE GARBAGE</p>
<p>Anees Jung starts the story with an introduction of a boy named Saheb – in a poor deplorable condition who miss their joy and childhood due to their socio-economic back ground. She speaks about the life of unfortunate rag pickers, migrated from Dhaka and settled in Seemapuri which is at the outskirts of Delhi. She starts the lesson with a description about the migrated rag pickers who lost their houses due to storm and shifted from Dhaka, Bangladesh to Seemapuri which is at the periphery (outskirts) of Delhi. The narrator watches the rag pickers, every morning in her neighbourhood. She presents Saheb as the representative of all other children engaged in garbage picking and always scrounges for gold. When she suggested him to go to school his reply was that there is no school in his neighbourhood. When she has come to know about his name that is Saheb-e-Alam which means ‘Lord of the Universe’, she felt the contrast between his life and the meaning of his name. She says that the Lord of the Universe is reachable for everything while the children in the story are unreachable for many things. Sometimes they find a coin or two from the garbage. They have ambitions but don’t know how to achieve it.
Anees Describes a story, that was narrated by a man from Udupi, about young who prayed God to give a pair of shoes and a prayer which was made by another boy that he doesn’t want to miss the shoes that he had. In Seemapuri the lives of children are different. She speaks about the families Dhaka to Seemapuri which was a wilderness (uncultivated) in 1971. They live in the houses which are the structures of mud, with roofs of tin and tarpaulin, and in the surroundings of sewage, drainage, or running water. They lived there for thirty years without an identity but with a ration card that get their names in the voter’s list. But for them it was a source to get grain for them. Even though they live in their transit (temporary) homes. Children grow in the garbage becomes the partners of it and for them survival in Seemapuri means rag picking. For children it is a gift wrapped in wonder but for elders it is a matter survival and daily bread.  Later when Saheb started to work in the tea stall the narrator says that the job helped him to earn Rs 800 per day but he has lost his carefree look. The job had taken his freedom away because the garbage bag that he used to carry was his own and the tea canister that he carries is belongs to the man who owns the tea shop and now Saheb is not his own master as he will have work according to the order of the tea shop owner.</p>
<p>I WANT TO DRIVE A CAR</p>
<p>It’s a description about the impoverished bangle makers of Firozabad and their lives are represented by Mukesh. He said to the narrator that his house is newly constructed but seemed to be half thatched house in which she finds a frail looking young woman whom Mukesh introduces as hi elder brother’s wife. Even though she is very young, she has taken the responsibility of the family on her shoulders.  His father couldn’t give education to his children, failed in renovating the house but taught the art bangle making. Mukesh’s grandmother who has seen her husband lost his eyesight while polishing the bangles console herself saying that, that was the destiny of her husband. Anees further describes that everywhere in Firozabad they can see only spirals of bangles.
She describes Savita a young girl sitting with an old lady to make bangles. Savita doesn’t know the auspiciousness of bangles while the old lady who complains that the bangle making never had supported her to get one time meal to fill their stomach. Her husband was able to provide a house for the family while others failed in it. As she has done a study about the lives of people there, she says that they are in a vicious circle where their lives begin from poverty and greed to apathy and injustice. As a conclusion she says that she found two distinct worlds that is the families caught in a web of poverty, burdened by the stigma (label) of caste in which they are born and the other is the vicious circle of the sahukars, the middlemen, the policemen, the keepers of law, the bureaucrats and the politicians. These two distinct worlds together have put the baggage of bangle making on their shoulder and by the time they come to know about it, he would have been a part of it and can’t be escaped. Mukesh is living in such surroundings that he is not sure whether he will be able to fulfil his dream but he is ready to walk to the garage if the society permits him to think differently and become a motor mechanic.</p>

              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5>The story Deep Water has been taken from the author’s autobiography “Of Men and Mountains”. In the piece of writing, he describes how he became a victim of the aversion towards water. And how he conquered it by will power and determination. When he was at the age of three or four, he was in the habit of going to the beach of California, with his father. He was highly frightened due to the huge waves that blown over him and entered into his nose and ears. 
In spite of having great fear in his mind, he was so eager to learn swimming but couldn’t because of the fear of water. Finally, he had decided to appoint a trainer to train him. He went to the pool five days a week, an hour each day. The instructor put a belt around him with a rope attached to the belt went through a pulley that ran overhead cable. He held on to the end of the rope and went on forth and back across the pool hour after hour, day after day and week after week. Whenever the instructor released the rope a terror and panic seized him and he went under the water. Then the instructor taught him to put his face under the water and exhale and raise his nose to inhale. He repeated the exercise hundreds of times. Bit by bit he shed part of the panic that seized him. Gradually he became confident and when the instructor realized that his part of teaching is over, he said to him that he is capable to have any stroke in water.
Douglas still was doubtful whether he is capable. He had decided to make it sure and went to Lake Wentworth in New Hampshire, dived off a dock at Trigs Island and swam two miles across the lake to Stamp act Island and swam the crawl, breast stroke, side stroke and back stroke. Once the terror returned when he was in the middle of the lake and he put his face under water and saw nothing other than bottomless water. The same old terror came back to his mind but he laughed and said to the terror whether it is trying to frighten him and terror had gone away. Even though he was successful in winning over the terror, he had residual doubts and he tried in different places to win over water and was successful. The experience gave him deep realization that in death there is peace and there is terror only in the fear of death. He had experienced both death and fear and he believe in the famous words of President Roosevelt that we need to fear only the fear itself. At last, he felt relaxed that nothing will be a hindrance for any one like him to reach to their goals.

              <h5><p>The narrator of the story implies that spring is the season associated with optimism and hope and in the life span of a human being childhood is the stage associated with optimism and hope. In fact, it is the most beautiful stage in the life of a human being. Spring season evokes a new beginning and hopes but the children described in the narration shows that they have lost hopes about life and the name ‘Lost Spring’ is symbolically given to show that they have lost their childhood. ‘The Lost Spring’ written by Anees Jung talks about the labour that is forced on children, to live a life of poverty and exploitation They don’t live their childhood as they have to carry the burden of poverty and illiteracy.</p>

<p>I – SOMETIMES I FIND A RUPEE IN THE GARBAGE</p>
<p>Anees Jung starts the story with an introduction of a boy named Saheb – in a poor deplorable condition who miss their joy and childhood due to their socio-economic back ground. She speaks about the life of unfortunate rag pickers, migrated from Dhaka and settled in Seemapuri which is at the outskirts of Delhi. She starts the lesson with a description about the migrated rag pickers who lost their houses due to storm and shifted from Dhaka, Bangladesh to Seemapuri which is at the periphery (outskirts) of Delhi. The narrator watches the rag pickers, every morning in her neighbourhood. She presents Saheb as the representative of all other children engaged in garbage picking and always scrounges for gold. When she suggested him to go to school his reply was that there is no school in his neighbourhood. When she has come to know about his name that is Saheb-e-Alam which means ‘Lord of the Universe’, she felt the contrast between his life and the meaning of his name. She says that the Lord of the Universe is reachable for everything while the children in the story are unreachable for many things. Sometimes they find a coin or two from the garbage. They have ambitions but don’t know how to achieve it.
Anees Describes a story, that was narrated by a man from Udupi, about young who prayed God to give a pair of shoes and a prayer which was made by another boy that he doesn’t want to miss the shoes that he had. In Seemapuri the lives of children are different. She speaks about the families Dhaka to Seemapuri which was a wilderness (uncultivated) in 1971. They live in the houses which are the structures of mud, with roofs of tin and tarpaulin, and in the surroundings of sewage, drainage, or running water. They lived there for thirty years without an identity but with a ration card that get their names in the voter’s list. But for them it was a source to get grain for them. Even though they live in their transit (temporary) homes. Children grow in the garbage becomes the partners of it and for them survival in Seemapuri means rag picking. For children it is a gift wrapped in wonder but for elders it is a matter survival and daily bread.  Later when Saheb started to work in the tea stall the narrator says that the job helped him to earn Rs 800 per day but he has lost his carefree look. The job had taken his freedom away because the garbage bag that he used to carry was his own and the tea canister that he carries is belongs to the man who owns the tea shop and now Saheb is not his own master as he will have work according to the order of the tea shop owner.</p>
<p>I WANT TO DRIVE A CAR</p>
<p>It’s a description about the impoverished bangle makers of Firozabad and their lives are represented by Mukesh. He said to the narrator that his house is newly constructed but seemed to be half thatched house in which she finds a frail looking young woman whom Mukesh introduces as hi elder brother’s wife. Even though she is very young, she has taken the responsibility of the family on her shoulders.  His father couldn’t give education to his children, failed in renovating the house but taught the art bangle making. Mukesh’s grandmother who has seen her husband lost his eyesight while polishing the bangles console herself saying that, that was the destiny of her husband. Anees further describes that everywhere in Firozabad they can see only spirals of bangles.
She describes Savita a young girl sitting with an old lady to make bangles. Savita doesn’t know the auspiciousness of bangles while the old lady who complains that the bangle making never had supported her to get one time meal to fill their stomach. Her husband was able to provide a house for the family while others failed in it. As she has done a study about the lives of people there, she says that they are in a vicious circle where their lives begin from poverty and greed to apathy and injustice. As a conclusion she says that she found two distinct worlds that is the families caught in a web of poverty, burdened by the stigma (label) of caste in which they are born and the other is the vicious circle of the sahukars, the middlemen, the policemen, the keepers of law, the bureaucrats and the politicians. These two distinct worlds together have put the baggage of bangle making on their shoulder and by the time they come to know about it, he would have been a part of it and can’t be escaped. Mukesh is living in such surroundings that he is not sure whether he will be able to fulfil his dream but he is ready to walk to the garage if the society permits him to think differently and become a motor mechanic.</p>

              <h5>The story Rattrap speaks about a peddler who went around selling small rattraps of wire, which were made by him at odd hours. Whenever he found the business not profitable, he uses to do thievery and begging. He always seemed to be sad and his life remained monotonous (same style without any change). He lived like a Vagabond (one who doesn’t have any particular determined destination like a butterfly) One day a strange thought had come to his mind that the whole world is a Rattrap and the things that make the people attracted are its baits. The moment a person touch on the bait (pork, cheese etc.) the whole world close behind him. The world was never kind to him and people use to chase him away and it became his pastime entertainment to think the whole world is a Rattrap.
 One dark evening he reached to a cottage where an old man lives alone in his loneliness and was so much interested to get someone to speak. He was a very good host and had shown the generosity to give him Porridge, tobacco and played Msjolis. As he was a lonely man, he had spoken a lot to him including the information that he is having a cow which helps him to fulfil his need and also had shown him the bag that is hanging near the window pane in which there was thirty kronor. It was a different experience for him and in the morning after saying good bye to the Crofter he came back, smashed the windowpane and stolen the money. He ran leaving the Highway thinking that the Police may find him and began to run through the forest. Very late in the evening he realized that he was running in a circular motion and got tired. He realized that the money was his bait and he really had fallen in the world of Rattrap.  Before losing his sense, he heard the voice of beating the iron, that is coming from an iron mill which helped himself drag to the mill so that he can take shelter in that winter night. After sometimes the iron master had come there and recognized him as one of his comrades in the Army and invited him to his home which was rejected by the peddler. He kept saying ‘No’ for any of the words used by the ironmaster. He only wanted a place to stay at night and he was afraid whether the police may catch him as the money was in his pocket. But after sometimes Edla Willmanson, the daughter of the iron master reached there in a cart and insisted him to be their guest as it is Christmas. She also added that after her mother’s death they haven’t celebrated Christmas in a grand way. He found it as equal to throw himself into the hands of the police but got convinced and gone with her. In the cart he was under tension whether it would be caught or not. In the house of the iron master, he was given the arrangements to get ready for the Christmas party and the Iron master had gone to sleep with a promise that he will meet him at the breakfast table. But in the morning, he had realized that he had got mistaken as he met him in the dim light and in the broad daylight, he found it as a mistake. 
  When he started to question him, he said that it is not his mistake and he was not ready to follow him. The iron master threatened him about the possibility of a police case but he replied that the whole world is a big Rattrap in which people fall into it due to luxury and many more other things like that. The ironmaster asked him to leave the house at once but Edla convinced him to permit him to stay back. Finally, he had agreed.  The whole day that he stayed there kept on eating and sleeping. When he was called for the dinner on the Christmas eve, he helped himself only to eat and went around to convey his gratitude and Edla told him that her father wanted to convey that he can keep the dress with him and for the next Christmas if he couldn’t find any place to spend, he can visit their home and he went to sleep to sleep.
  The next morning when they have gone to church, they have come to know about the loss of money from Crofter. The iron master began to doubt him and hurried to their home back. When they have reached back the servant informed them that the guest had gone leaving a small gift. It was so badly wrapped and she found a small rattrap and three wrinkled notes and a letter. It was written: -
He was grateful to her to consider him as a captain and he want to continue as a captain for not to disgrace her. So, wants to leave all the odd ways and continue with the standard of a captain. He also requested her to return back the money to the Crofter. 
He concluded his letter by saying that the Rattrap is a gift from a rat that would have fallen into the stream of the world where there are a lot of baits and chances for a person to be caught hold off on it. He had continued to say that he had written it with friendship and high regard which was clear that he wanted to continue it.

              <h5><p>In the narration Indigo Louis Fischer describes his meeting with Mahatma Gandhi at his Ashram in Sewagram. Gandhi described him about the occasion in which he understood the necessity of Indian Independence. It was in 1916 when he had gone to the Annual Convention of the Indian National Congress party in Lucknow. He happened to meet Raj Kumar Shukla, a peasant who has come from Champaran which is at the foothills of the towering Himalayas. Raj Kumar Shukla wanted to explain about the agreement of sharecropping. He was illiterate but resolute. Gandhi informed him about his engagement but he kept on accompanying Gandhi wherever he had gone. Finally, when Gandhi had completed his meetings, he had decided to find the truth behind the complaint of Raj Kumar Shukla. 
 In Champaran first of all they have gone to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad, where they were not even permitted to draw water from the well. The servant of Rajendra Prasad had mistaken Gandhi as untouchable as he had come with Raj Kumar Shukla. He felt that if they draw water from the well, the water drops that are spilt from the bucket may pollute the well. 

  Gandhi first decided to go to Muzaffarpur which was on the way to Champaran to get complete information. He sent a telegram to Prof. J.B. Kripalani of the Arts College in Muzaffarpur whom he had seen in Tagore’s Shanti Niketan School and when the train arrived on 15th April 1917 at midnight Pro. Kripalani was waiting at the station with a large number of students, Gandhi stayed there for two days in the house of Pro. Malkani and it was not so easy for Govt, teacher to give shelter to a person who was a member of Home Rule. The news of Gandhi’s advent brought the peasants to Muzaffarpur to meet Gandhi.
  In Muzaffarpur he met lawyers and criticized them to take the illiterate farmers to the court. Most of the cultivable lands in Champaran district was divided into large estates owned by English men and worked by Indian farmers. The Landlords compelled all the farmers to plant 15% of the land with Indigo and surrender the entire crop to the land lords. When the landlords have come to know that synthetic Indigo is available from Germany, they wanted to get rid of these farmers. Some of them willingly signed and some are signed due to the force. When they come to know about the synthetic Indigo, they demanded their money back and it was in this point Gandhi reached in Champaran.
First of all, he visited the Secretary of British Landlord’s Association but the Secretary denied giving information saying Gandhi as an outsider and advised him to leave Tirhut. Gandhi did not leave and proceeded to Motihari, the capital of Champaran. On the way Police Superintendent’s messenger overtook him and ordered him to return to town in his carriage. Gandhi signed a receipt for notice and wrote on it that he would disobey the order. As a result of its Gandhi received a summons to appear in court the next day. In the morning Motihari filled with the peasants who have come to protest against the order. The officials found it difficult to control the crowd and seek for the help from Gandhi for which Gandhi quietly controlled them. Through this Gandhi was giving them the concrete proof that their power that remained unquestioned can be questioned by Indians.
  Gandhi read the statement and replied that the conflict of duty was not to set a bad example as a lawbreaker but to render humanitarian and National Service. He is regarded the order to fulfil the voice of his conscience. Finally, the Judge freed him. Several days later Gandhi received a written Communication from the Magistrate informing him that the Lieutenant Governor had ordered to drop the case against him. In June Gandhi was summoned to Sir Edward Gait, the Lieutenant Governor followed by four protracted interviews and arranged a commission to inquire about the condition of sharecroppers in which landlords, Govt. officials and Gandhi as the whole sole representative of the peasants. The inquiry proved against the landlords and found the farmers deserve compensation. Gandhi asked for 50% but was agreed with an offer of 25%. Through this Gandhi explained that the amount of the compensation was not important but the fact that the landlords had been obliged to surrender part of money and part of their prestige. By remaining for the continuous seven months Gandhi had managed the problems in the ashram also are sorted out. He arranged Primary education and common medicines for the people in Champaran with the help of his wife and son. Gandhi began to think about the possibility of Indian Independence thus the narrator says </p>
<p>“Self-Reliance, Indian independence and help to sharecroppers were all bound together”.</p>

              <h5><p>The poem starts with a temporary departure of a mother and daughter. It gives an autobiographical note. The poet who was driving from her parent’s home to the Cochin Airport, the previous Friday morning. She looked at her mother sitting beside her. She observed that her mother, sleeping, opening her mouth wide. Her face was pale and dull like a dead body. The poet has used the poetic device Simile to compare her mother’s face like the dead body. She realized with great pain that she was so old that she may die at any time but she put that thought away and diverted her thought to the sprinting young trees and the merry children spilling out of their homes. This was a contrasted comparison made by the poet that her mother is old and possible to face death and decay so soon but the young trees and children are the representation for energetic life with a lot of time left.
      She continues to say that after the security check in the airport, a few yards away she looked again at her mother’s face. Her face looked like the late winter’s moon. The significance of the late winter’s moon is that it is pale unpleasant and possible to be faded soon. The figure of speech used here is Simile again. When she thought about the late winter’s moon the old familiar childhood fear came to her mind that is separation or loss of her mother. But she didn’t say anything other than ‘see you soon amma’ because she was hopeful that she may meet her again. She only did was smile, smile and smile to hide her feelings from her mother. The poet concludes the poem .</p>

              <p><em> About the Author:-Sir Stephen spender (28 February1909 -16 July 1995) was an English poet, novelist and an essayist who concentrated on themes of social injustice and the class struggle in his work.

              <h5><p>The poem, “An Elementary School Classroom in a Slum”, written by Stephen Spender, highlights harsh realities of life in slum. It describes an elementary school in a slum. The children studying there look pathetic.  The expressions of these children are withered and worn out like uprooted weeds. It is unclear like blowing waves. Their hair is scattered untidily around their pale faces. The theme of the poem is insecure and unclear condition of these children. The tall girl has the weighed down head because of the burden of the seriousness of life. Another boy is weak and timid who has rat’s eyes. It is symbolic to their poverty and hunger as a rat’s eyes are always engaged in the search for food and contentment. Another boy who is stunted with twisted bones is the unlucky heir of his father’s gnarled disease. He is reciting his lessons from the desk. At the back of the unpleasant class room a sweet and young boy is sitting not noted by anybody and lost in the world of dreams. He has created his own fantastic world where he dreams about a frolic and free life. His eyes live in a dream of squirrel’s game in its tree room and the unpleasant condition doesn’t inspire him to sit in the classroom.
The walls of the Elementary classroom are not pleasant as it is not painted from such a long time. There are different pictures hanging in the classroom which seemed to be the donations. There is the picture of Shakespeare’s head which is ironical that the literary master’s portrait where no serious teaching takes place, beautiful valley full of fragrant flowers that the children can never experience their fragrance and beauty since they are condemned to live in the limitations of slum. There are open handed maps which are a window to see the whole world but for these children, these are not their windows as the slum in which they live where their future is not secure and a narrow street roofed with the dull grey sky, is not marked in the map. So, their lives are limited and very far away from rivers, mountains and the words of stars. Their lives are confined within the narrow dusty streets and sealed with the dull concrete sky. 
  Shakespeare is meaningless for them since they don’t know anything about the importance of Shakespeare in literature. Map is a bad example because the slum in which they live is not marked in the map. Neither literary beauty nor scenic beauty affects them. Their lives that are limited in the congested holes begin from fog (unclear childhood) to endless night (insecure future) Their whole life is crushed and cramped in unhealthy filthy holes and gets wasted on heaps of slag and garbage and they look mere skeletons as their bones peep through their skins. Their existence is caught hold of the search in the leftovers or garbage. The fragility of their lives is compared to the spectacles made of steel and their mended glasses are possible to lose its existence at any time like bits of bottle on stones. The children spent all their time in the foggy slums which comprise their world. The poet evokes the readers to blot their maps to bring their lives to a dignified world and bring their world as high as doom.
  It is a harsh reality that there is no improvement which can be taken place in their lives unless Governor, Inspector or a visitor comes to school to find a solution for their insecure lives. In such condition the maps hanging in the classroom are their windows because only through these maps they can see the world beyond their slum. According to them these windows are like their lives like catacombs where there is only one side opening and the other side closed like endless nights. There is no other side for these catacombs for them to escape from the dark areas of their lives. So, the poet advocates breaking all the limitations of slum children so that they can explore their fundamental rights of freedom and education. He wants them to enjoy the freedom of green fields and golden sands. The poet’s earnest wish is that they should be allowed to read all the books and enable them even to learn things from nature. The poet concludes his poem on a positive note that only those people who get inspired of knowledge and learning can create history. He wants to create opportunities to bring them to the level that only the sun can limit can their abilities.

              <h4> PABLO NERUDA </h4>
              <p><em> About the Author:-Ricardo Elecer Neftali Reyes Basoalto (12 July 1904-23 September 1973) known by his pen name Pablo Neruda, was a Chilean poet – diplomat and politician. Neruda became a poet since when he was 13 years old, and wrote in a variety of styles including surrealism, historical epics, political manifestos and prose autobiography. Pablo Neruda, a revolutionary poet describes the necessity of a person to think over the past, present and future. The poem keeping quiet shows the suggestion put forward by the poet about the necessity of quiet introspection to create a feeling of mutual understanding among human beings. It helps us know how moment of introspection will make us realize the utter futility of our aggressive endeavours.

            <h3 class="resume-title">SUMMARY</h3>
              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5><p>The poet begins his poem saying that he will count till twelve and invokes the readers to keep quiet.  He says that at least once in the lifespan of a person will have to meditate. No one should speak in any language and not to do any work. He asks the readers stop for one second from doing any activity so that it will be a strange moment where there is no rush without engines. He inspires readers that they must go for a sudden strangeness which may help them to think over the past, present and future.
The poet says that the fishermen should leave their selfishness in striving for the biggest fish and the salt gatherers should stop their activities for a moment to think over the damage that took place on their hands as a result of their continuous effort on it for their livelihood. They should try to understand that the greed destroys oneself and the others.
The poet continues saying that those who prepare green wars, wars with gas, and wars with fire should realize the futility of victory with no survivors to celebrate it. In that moment, all these war mongers should come out of their blood shedding and begin to walk about keeping a feeling of brotherhood in the shade. The poet says that the word ‘inactivity ‘should not be mistaken for ‘death’. The life of a human being will keep on moving and this inactivity is connected to life. If we move selfishly without sharing our feelings with others, it may create sadness in their minds which may destroy one. If we could stop for one moment, we may be able to interrupt the sadness of never understanding ourselves and the world. But just a moment of Introspection can save a person from the world of loneliness and give hopes in mind to think about future instead of living with the thought of death. Hence the poet leaves the readers in a moment where they will start to count till twelve and start introspection
 The poem leaves a message of universal brotherhood and peace. If we think about the hands of the clock moving in routine, which pass the message that life should move on the poem is consisted on paradox and a pun on the word. The face of the earth becomes the face of the clock which keeps on moving through the lifespan of human beings. ‘Green wars ‘refers to new wars like revolutions and put on clean clothes and shade represent peace.

              <h5><p>The theme of the poem is based on male domination over society who expect women be dutiful wives. The image used in the poem is a husband (Society) who controls and frightens his wife (women). The tiger in the poem is pictured as always prancing.
The poem starts with an image which shows the expression of Aunt Jennifer’s mind in the world of male domination. The tigers knitted by Aunt Jennifer in the green panel are bright yellow in colour. They are not afraid of the men in the world around. They majestically pace their feet to surety with alert, brave movements.
While knitting the tiger, Aunt Jennifer’s fingers were fluttering through the panel. She found difficulty in pulling the ivory needle because of the oppression faced through the wedding band that she is wearing. It remains symbolic of her sufferings in her married life which represents the customs and ordeals that were supposed to be undergone by a woman after marriage.
The poet says that even after her death, her frightened hands representing her oppressed life will remain symbolic of her life without freedom. Still the tigers created by her will go on prancing on the panel proud and brave as symbol of her dignified mind which is elegant and fearless.</p>

              <h5><p>The Presidents of the New York Central and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroads will swear on a pile of time table that there are only two levels but according to the narrator (Charley) there are three levels because he had travelled through the Third Level in the Grand Central Station. When he had spoken about it to his psychiatrist friend, he said that it was only a hallucination of his mind. He said that the narrator was unhappy. This made his wife to feel a kind of madness. His psychiatrist friend explained in the modern world, people are filled with full of insecurity, fear, war, worry and a lot more. The narrator wants to escape from all; in fact, everybody in the world wants to escape. The only difference is that everybody doesn’t want to wander down any third level in the Grand central station. 
According to his friends, even his stamp collection also is a part of his escapism. Through his hobby, he tries to get a temporary shelter to escape from reality. As a reply for this he says that he has got that hobby from his grandfather, who was never in need of a shelter from reality and he led a peaceful life in his time. In his collection there were every issue of first day covers. Moreover, President Roosevelt also used to collect stamps.</p>
<p>Further he explains what happened at Grand Central. One summer night he worked late at his office and was in a hurry to reach his apartment. So, he had selected the subway, which is faster than the bus. Being an ordinary person, named Charley, thirty-one years old, wearing a closely woven, yellowish brown suit and a straw hat with a fancy band. He passed a dozen men who looked just like him. He only wanted to reach to Louisa, his wife.</p>
He turned into Grand Central from Vanderbilt Avenue and went down the steps to first level, where people board train in the Twentieth Century, then he walked down other stairs to the Second Level, where the trains to the outskirts, leaves. Then he entered into an arched doorway heading for the subway and lost his way. He had travelled through Grand Central, hundreds of times but he always enter again to the new doorways, stairs and corridors repeatedly. Once he entered into a tunnel about a mile and came out in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. Another time he came up in an office building on forty Sixth Street, which is three blocks away. 
He continues to say that sometimes he thinks that Grand Central is growing like a tree where there are a lot of corridors and staircases like the roots of trees spread everywhere. There is a tunnel which moves under the city and opens to Times Square. He didn’t speak about it to his psychiatrist friend because for many years, it has been an exit for many people.
<p>He continued through the corridor where he couldn’t see or hear anybody and the only sound, he heard was his own footsteps. He kept on walking and heard a sort of hollow roar ahead which indicates an open space and the presence of people. The tunnel turned sharp left and turned and went down through a short flight of stairs. And came out on the third level of the Central station. For a moment he felt that he is in the second level but the room was smaller and there were fewer ticket windows and train gates. The information booth in the ticket was wood and old looking. The man in the booth wore a green eye shade and long black sleeve protectors. The lights were dim and flickering open-flame gaslights. There were brass spit buckets on the floor. A man who was wearing a derby hat, a black four button suit with tiny lapels, had pulled a gold watch from his vest pocket to see the time. Then he looked around to see that everyone in the station was dressed like 1890 and like that. A woman who walked in through the train wore a dress with leg-of-mutton sleeves and skirts to the top of her high buttoned shoes, and the locomotives with a small currier and Ives locomotive with a funnel shaped stack was visible. He walked over to a newsboy and glanced at the paper and found it as the publication of ‘The World’, which hasn’t been published for years. In the front page and the published date was June 11, 1894, the lead story was about President Cleveland. He turned towards the ticket windows of the Grand Central ticket windows to buy tickets for him and his wife, Louisa, to take them anywhere in the United States. They wanted to visit, Galesburg, Illinois, in the year 1894. 
Illinois is a wonderful town, quiet, with big old frame houses, huge lawns, the men smoking cigars and talking quietly, the women waving palm leave fans, with the fireflies all around, in a peaceful world. He wanted two tickets to visit Illinois. The clerk had shown him the fare, glancing at his fancy hatband and he was having enough money with him to buy ticket for one way. When he counted the money, the clerk was staring at him and nodded his head looking at the currency he was having in his hands. He warned him, if he was trying to play a trick with him, it would be difficult for him to escape from there. Charley looked into the cash drawer with the clerk and found them as old currencies. He remembered that there is nothing good in the jail in 1894 also, so left the place.</p>
He left the same way that he entered. Next day during lunch hour in the office, he has gone to the bank and withdrawn all the money he had in his account to buy old currency from a coin dealer by paying a premium amount. (He paid three hundred dollars and received nearly two hundred dollars). 
<p>Even though he searched for the way to third level to buy tickets, he had never again found the corridor that leads to the third level at Grand Central station. He tried it more than once but couldn’t find the way. His wife was worried when he said this to her and advised him not to search for it again. After a while he stopped searching for it. Then he had diverted his attention to stamp collection again. But he believes that the third level still exists. His friend Sam Weiner, seemed to be disappeared he used to tell to Charley that he liked the sound of the place, and Charley strongly believes that he has gone to 1894, Illinois.</p>

<p>One night as he was going through his stamp collection, he found a first day cover (when a new stamp is issued, stamp collectors buy some and use them to mail envelops to themselves on the very first day of the sail and the postmark proves the date. This envelope is called a first day cover leaving a blank paper. They are never opened) the first day cover, he found was the one which was mailed by someone to his grandfather, at his home in Galesburg. He understood it from the address in the envelope. It had been there since July 18, 1894.The stamp was of a six cent, dull brown, with a picture of President Carfield. When this has come to his granddad, he has put that into his collection and stayed there till Charley got it from the collection. The paper inside was with a note on it addressing Charley saying that he was right about third level, and travelling through third level he had reached to Illinois and enjoying the music there, waiting for Charley and Louisa signed by Sam. </p>
<p>Charley went to the old coin store and found out that Sam bought eight hundred dollars’ worth of old-style currency, which may help him up in a nice little hay, feed and grain business that he always wanted to do but certainly couldn’t go back to his business. Now Charley wonders why Sam was his Psychiatrist.

              <h5><p>His Highness Jamedar General Khiledar Major, Sada Vyaghra Samhari, Maharajadhiraja Visva Bhuvana Samrat, Sir Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur M.A.D., A.C.T.C, OR C.R.C.R, is the hero of the story The Tiger King. The narrator says the reason for him to be known as Tiger King. He expresses his determination to complete his mission without any interruption; even a stuka bomber can’t stop him. He says that he is going to disclose a matter of vital importance about the tiger king. If anybody wants meet the hero of the story, it’s impossible as the tiger king had already dead and the manner of the death of the tiger king is a matter of extraordinary interest.
</p>
<p>As soon as the king born astrologers predicted one day the tiger king would die which was replied back by the ten days old boy that all those who take birth in this world would die one day and insisted to predict it completely and they described that the child would grow up into a great warrior, a hero and a champion but was born in the hour of the Bull which are the enemies of tigers. To the surprise of everyone, the ten days old child replied that the tigers should be worried about the bulls</p>

<p>The boy grew by enjoying all the facilities like all other princes in the world. All the people in the kingdom were aware of the astrologer’s prediction and discussed about it and finally the king who had forgotten about the prediction have come to know about it. The Maharaja had taken the old saying that you could kill a cow for the sake of one’s own defence as his philosophy and began to hunt the tigers in the country. When the King had shown the dead tiger to the astrologer, he warned the Maharaja, to be very careful about the hundredth tiger. The king questioned him about the after effect of his killing the hundredth tiger, the astrologer replied that in such case he would cut his tuft and become an insurance agent. The king had restricted everybody even from throwing a stone to the tigers in the country. At that time there came a high-ranking British Officer with the wish to hunt a tiger and get a photograph with it. But the king disagreed and managed to save the kingdom and throne by gifting fifty diamond rings with the cost of three lakhs rupees.
</p>

<p>After killing seventy tigers, the king found the scarcity of tigers in the country. As a solution for it he got married with a princess from a kingdom where there is a vast area of forest and number of tigers. Whenever he visited his father – in – laws kingdom he hunts five or six tigers and managed to kill ninety-nine tigers. But he couldn’t find the hundredth tiger. He has called the Dewan and warned to find the tiger otherwise face the trouble of doubling the tax or any other destruction. Dewan who was afraid of the loss of his job and life had gone to the People’s Park in Madras and brought an old tiger which had launched a Satyagraha, when they reached in Pratibandapuram. The tiger was placed in the forest and informed the king about the presence of the tiger in the forest. With great happiness the king had arrived there and shot the tiger. The king was happy to complete his target but the tiger was not dead. It was unconscious due to the whizzing sound of the bullet passed. The hunters decided not to inform about it as they were afraid of the angriness of the king and the loss of their job. So, one of them shot the tiger and carried to the palace for the final procession and buried. A tomb was erected over it.
</p>

<p>A few days later the Maharaja had decided to celebrate the third birthday of his son. He wanted to buy a gift for his son and bought a wooden tiger. It has been carved by an unskilled carpenter and its surface was rough. The tiny silvers of wood stood up like quills all over it and one of those silvers pierced the Maharaja’s right hand. The next day infection flared all over the arm. Three famous surgeons were brought from Madras who have decided to perform an operation which was done well by them and he was dead. Thus, the hundredth tiger took its final revenge upon the tiger king.

              <h5><p>The narration speaks about the journey done by the narrator, to the coldest, driest, windiest continent of the world Antarctica. She has started her journey in a Russian research vessel named Akademic Shokalskiy, from 1309, degree north of the equator in Madras and it involved the crossing of nine time zones, six checkpoints, three bodies of water and at least as many ecospheres.
She travelled 100 hours in combination of a car, an aeroplane and a ship to reach to Antarctica and her first emotion was relief followed by wonder to imagine how there could ever have been a time when India and Antarctica were part of the same landmass.

</p>
<p>PART OF HISTORY</p>
<p>Six hundred and fifty million years ago, a huge, blend of Southern Super Continent Gondwana.centered roughly around the first day Antarctica. At that time things were quite different and humans hadn’t arrived on the global scene and the climate was quite warmer having a huge variety of flora and fauna. For 500 million years Gondwana flourished but as a result of the changes in the climate and vegetation, when the dinosaurs were wiped out and the age of the mammals got underway, the landmass was forced to separate into countries shaping the globe into the present condition.
Now, a visit to Antarctica is to be a part of history. It is important to understand the importance of Cordilleran folds and Pre- Cambrian granite shields, Ozone and carbon evolution and extinction. It is mind boggling to imagine India pushing northwards jamming against Asia to buckle its crust and form the Himalayas; south America drifting off to North America, opening up the Drake passage to create a cold circumpolar current. As a result of it Antarctica turns very cold, deserted of inhabitants and at the bottom of the world.
The narrator felt, for a sun worshipping South Indian like herself two weeks in a place where 90 percent of the Earth’s total ice volumes are stored, is really a chilling experience and beyond imagination for all functioning. She felt it just as walking into a giant ping-pong ball without trees billboards or buildings, only to experience occasional avalanche or calving ice sheet. 
</p>

<p>HUMAN IMPACT</p>
<p>Human civilisation began to exist for 12,000 years and according to the geological clock this is only few seconds. In this short duration of time, human beings have created huge destruction to the earth expressing their ability in making, villages, towns, cities and megacities. Rapid increase in human population forced human beings to battle with other species for limited resources. The burning of fossil fuel in an unlimited quantity, created a blanket of Carbon dioxide around the world increased the average global temperature. 
The present contesting debate is climate changing with a question whether the West Antarctic ice melts entirely, or will the Gulf Stream Ocean current be disrupted? Will it be the end of the world? Ultimately Antarctica remains a crucial element. Not because it is the only place in the world which has never sustained a human population but because it holds in its ice cores half-million-year-old carbon records trapped in its layers of ice. According to the narrator if we want to study and examine the earth’s past, present and future, Antarctica is the best place.
The narrator was working on the programme, ‘Students on Ice ‘with Shokalskiy by taking high school students to the end of the world providing them with inspiring educational opportunities which will help them with new understanding and respect our planet. It began for six years headed by Canadian Geoff Green offering the future generation of policy makers a life changing experience at an age when they are ready to absorb learn and act accordingly. 
Due to simple eco system and lack of bio diversity Antarctica is the perfect place to study the little changes that creates big repercussions. Best example is Phyto plankton which nourishes the entire southern ocean’s food chain, using the sun’s energy to assimilate carbon and synthesis organic compounds processes called photosynthesis which is warned by scientists about the possible disaster on earth. The metaphor that reveals through this is that take care of the small things and the big things will fall into place.

</p>

<p>WALK ON THE OCEAN</p>
<p>The narrator says that the journey done in Antarctica is full of miracles but the best she felt was at 65.55 degrees that the Shokalskiy got stuck and the captain asked them to climb down the gangplank and walk on the ocean. They began to walk on the ice in one meter thickness and 180 meters of living, breathing saltwater. At the outskirts they were able to see the crab eater seals taking rest on ice like stray dogs take rest under the shade of a banyan tree.
As a conclusion the narrator says that after travelling nine zones, six checkpoints, three bodies of water and many eco-spheres, she was wondering about the beauty of balance of the earth. She puts a question that how it would be if Antarctica become the warm place that it was used to be. After spending two weeks with a bunch of teenagers with an idealism to save the world, she says that a lot can happen in a million years so the difference that the efforts of a day can make is very important.

</p>
<p>The story ‘The Enemy’ is written in the background of World War. Dr. Sadao Hoki, a Japanese doctor, after his father’s death had settled in his house which was built on a spot of the Japanese coast whereas a little boy he had often played. The low square stone house was set upon rocks just above a narrow beach which was outlined by Pine trees. In his childhood his father used to take him to the islands of seas and tell him that those islands are the stepping stones to the future of Japan and the stepping stones begin from where an individual make it. Sadao had taken this as serious and did everything his father said. His father never joked or played with him but spent infinite pain upon him who was his only son. As Sadao knew that his education is his father’s only concern, he had completed his studies in Surgery and Medicine from America and at the age of thirty, before his father’s death he became a famous Scientist and Surgeon by perfecting a discovery which would render wounds entirely clean. As the war was going on he hadn’t been sent to the war front with the troops as the old General was in need of Medical Treatment. It was an evening a cloudy and misty evening, when he was remembering about the hospitality of the American Professor when he was in America where he met his wife Hana, he happened to see something black come out of the mists. It was a man who flung out of the ocean, staggered a few steps and fallen down. Sadao and Hana ran towards him and found him covered with sand on one side had already became a stain of red soaking with blood. He was a white man and unconscious.

</p>

<p>Expert fingers of Sadao began to search for the wound on the body of the man and found a gun wound on the right side of his lower back. The flesh there was blackened with gunpowder which was a clear evidence that the man was wounded only sometimes before. Sadao packed the wound with sea moss. For a moment they thought of putting him back to the sea. They knew that if they shelter a white man in their home, they would be arrested.   The man was recognized as a prisoner of war, by them with the help of the letters written on the cap that is ‘U.S. Navy’. After a long time, discussion, they took him to their home by taking the risk of harbouring an enemy in their home. 
</p>

<p>Their decision had been taken wrongly by the servants and they have decided to stop their service in his home as they were afraid of the punishment that may be forced to face by them. Sadao had started his surgery of the enemy in his father’s room which was traditionally set for the memory of his father, after his father’s death. Hana began to feel uncomfortable and began to vomit outside. Sadao felt impatient as he was helpless to go and help her. He always kept the professional philosophy taught by his American professor, “Ignorance of Human body is the surgeon’s cardinal sin”. After his expert surgery he has taken the bullet out and made sure that the man had crossed the dangerous zone of his life. While observing the piteously thin face of the POW, Hana remembered the stories that she read in the newspaper about the cruelty of General Takima. She remembered that the General, who used to beat his wife at home cruelly, would surely cruel to a POW. On the seventh day all the servants left home and in the afternoon a messenger came to inform Sadao that the old general wants to meet him. Sadao informed General about the whole story that had happened and how he had managed it. General had promised him to send assassins to kill the enemy as he cannot punish Sadao who is having the responsibility of saving the life of diseased General But for two three days nothing happened and finally Sadao himself had found a solution for his mental torture that he was facing by saving the enemy soldier. He had arranged a boat in which necessary things were set and sent the man to the islands with an instruction that if he is in need of food or any other, he should give two flash from the torch light provided by him and a single torch light every day to show him that he is still there in the island. Later Sadao had informed the General who had been operated by him that the POW had escaped. 


</p>



At night while standing at the veranda, he remembered, the Professor at whose house, he had met Hana, and his wife a talkative woman. He also had remembered his old Anatomy Professor who had been so insistent on mercy with the knife. Then he remembered his Landlady in America who had nursed him when he was suffering from influenza. Living in a country where there is a lot of prejudice in the minds of natives, is really a difficult task. He had justified his act of saving the POW, considering the hospitality that he had received in America, being Japanese.

              <h5><p> The story starts with a description about the weekly routine of Jack, the father of two children, Jo and Bobby. He was habitual in narrating story to his daughter, Jo, for Saturday naps. This custom of storytelling was started when Jo was two years old and it is carrying on for two years. Every Saturday he narrated same story with a little bit difference. In all the stories there always was a small creature, usually named Roger, like Roger Fish, Roger Chipmunk, and Roger Squirrel etc. He always had some problem He would go to the wise old owl and it would tell him to go to the Wizard, who would perform a magic spell that solved the problem and in turn would demand for more pennies than the Roger creature had. He would direct to go to the river side where extra pennies could be found. Then Roger would play with other creatures till when he hears the whistling sound of the train that brought his Daddy home from Boston. They would have their supper and the story will get over.
Sometimes jack feels disappointed as Jo never have shown any interest in sleeping. One Saturday Jo demanded to narrate the story of Roger Skunk. Jack started the story with a description about the Roger Skunk who lived in the dark deep woods. His name was Roger Skunk and he smelled very bad that other animals of the jungle would not play with him. Then the Roger Skunk had gone to the wise owl who had directed him to the Wizard who had changed the foul smell of the skunk to the smell of Roses. The wizard aske the Roger Skunk to pay seven pennies. The Roger Skunk was not having sufficient money but the Wizard advised it to go to the end of the lane and turn around three times and there in the magic well found the sufficient pennies with which the skunk paid the fees to the wizard. He played various games with others and when it became dark, they all ran to their houses. 
At home Roger skunk’s mother began to feel the smell of roses as awful and questioned him about it and the skunk replied that it is the Wizard who had changed his smell. She said that she would go to the Wizard and hit him on his head with her umbrella asking him to change the smell of Roses back to the same familiar foul smell of a skunk. The skunk said that other animals may run away but his mother was not at all bothered of it as her son should smell like a skunk. So, his mother took him to the wizard and changed his smell of Roses back to the foul smell. The Roger Skunk again began smell like a skunk and on that day at night the skunk’s mother hugged him and encouraged that he is smelling like her son in that foul smell. 
Jo was displeased of the end of the story. She wanted the Wizard to hit Roger’s mommy than changing the smell of the skunk. She asked Jack whether other animals ran away from him and Jack replied that other animals got used of it gradually and they began to play with him in his foul smell. Jo said that she was a stupid mommy to change the smell of her son. Jack asked her to sleep as her brother Bobby was sleeping. Jo requested him to change the end of the story next day that it should be the mother who is getting hit from the wizard and not to change the smell. Jack said that it was not the story of hers. The reality is that the little skunk loved his mommy than all the other animals. Moreover, she knew what was right. She again insisted that it should be the wizard who hit the mommy. He replied that he would see about it and asked her to sleep.
Jack had gone to down stairs to see what his wife Clare who is pregnant. The condition on downstairs made him to feel awkward that he felt that he had been caught in an ugly middle position that he didn’t want to speak, work or touch the work that is done by her.
