              <h4> JAMES HERRIOT </h4>
              <p><em> About the Author:-James Albert Wight (3rd October 1916-23rd February 1995), best known by his pen name James Herriot, was a British Veterinary Surgeon and writer. He was famous in writing a series of eight books set in 1930s to 1950s about the animals and their owners and the first publication was in 1970.</em></p>

            <h3 class="resume-title">SUMMARY</h3>
              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5>James Herriot, narrates his experience with Tricki, a dog, one of his patients and his mistress Mrs Pumphrey. As he was passing on the way, he happened to meet Mrs Pumphrey with tricki. He was worried to see Tricki who became fat, like a bloated sausage with leg at each corner. Mrs Pumphrey explained in a hurry that she found him weak with no energy and felt as suffering from loss of nutritious food. So, she began to give extra food to him extra food like some malt, cod-liver oil and a bowl of Horlicks at night to make him sleep. She continued saying that she couldn’t cut sweets from his diet as he likes cream cakes and chocolates. The doctor found that Tricki became greedy was ready to eat a meal at any time of the day. Mrs Pumphrey had given him a little walk and not much exercise was possible. Within few days Mr Herriot received a call from Mrs Pumphrey with a complaint that Tricki lost his interest even in his favourite in his food and a sensation of vomiting began to express. He spent all his time lying on a rug trying to get breath without moving and doing nothing. The doctor decided to get Tricki out of the house to save him and suggested to hospitalise him. Mrs Pumphrey was almost sad that she knew that Tricki can’t survive without seeing her and at the same time she has realised that he would die if the treatment is not given. Mr Herriot who was strongly determined have taken Tricki and walked towards his car. There was an expression of affection that the entire staff with Mrs Pumphrey, began to run with tricki’s day bed, night bed, favourite cushions, toys breakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl and many more things. Mr Herriot realised that there is not having sufficient space for all the stuff in his car and he started it. While moving he found that all of them were in tears and Tricki, sitting by the side, had wagged his tail. Mr Herriot had determined that he would cure the dog.
In the hospital all the other dogs admitted there gathered around but Tricki’s reaction was dull and they left the place considering him uninteresting. Mr Herriot arranged a place for Tricki and for the first two days, he did not give any food to him and allowed to drink plenty of water. By evening of the second day he began to react and on the third day he started to create a painful sound for the sounds of the dogs in the yard. Slowly he began to mingle with other dogs enjoying food and play games. Since then his health began to get improve. 
Mrs Pumphrey kept on getting information about the improvement of Tricki and when she came to know that he is out of danger, she started to bring fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up Tricki’s strength, followed by bottles of wine and brandy. The doctor and his partners had a happy time by consuming them with the egg in the morning, wine in the afternoon and brandy at night around bonfire. The doctor felt to keep the dog for a long time but he has informed Mrs Pumphrey that Tricki is alright and she can pick him from the hospital. In two weeks, he had become a strong muscled animal. When Tricki saw his mistress, he was so excited and jumped over her. Mrs Pumphrey said that it is the success of a doctor over a diseased patient.</h5>

              <h4> Questions and Answers </h4>
              <p> 1 What kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary surgeon is? Would you say he was tactful as well as full of common sense? </p>
<p> Mr Herriot, the narrator was a sensible person who could understand his patients at one stroke. He was tactful because very easily he was able to understand that Tricki is in a dangerous condition. He was a person with full of common sense because he has given his full patience and attention to Tricki to bring him to normal condition.</p>
<p>2   Do you think Tricki was happy to go home? What do you think will happen now?</p>
<p>Yes, Tricki was happy to go home. I think Mrs Pumphrey will understand her mistake of overfeeding to Tricki and take care for not to create same diseased condition for Tricki.</p>
<p>3 Do you think this is a real-life episode or mere fiction? Or is it a mixture of both?</p>
<p>‘A Triumph of Surgery’ is written in first person narration to show it as a real-life experience. It can be a mixture of both where it says that Mrs Pumphrey had sent eatables and alcohol to her pet which were enjoyed by the doctor and his partners. </p>

<h4>Think About It.</h4>

<p>“Griffin was rather a lawless person.” Comment.</p>
<p>Griffin was a brilliant scientist, who had successfully invented the medicine to turn objects with mass to be transparent. He was brilliant in using his intelligence but his behaviour of lawlessness made him to turn into a negative character. The best example is his attitude towards his landlord. His landlord disliked him and tried to eject him. As a part of taking revenge upon him, Griffin set fire to the house and ran away from there. He had removed his clothes to get away without being seen. His act of lawlessness brought him to be without clothes, without money and quite invisible. His abilities and intelligence which could have been used for the prosperity of society and country had become meaningless and a matter of inconvenience for himself because of his lawlessness.</p>
<p>How would you assess Griffin as a Scientist?</p>

If he would have been used his invention for a good cause, it would have helped for the development of technology.</p>

              <p> How did a book become a turning point in Richard Ebright’s life?</p>
<p> ‘The Travels of Monarch X’, a children’s book, gifted by her mother, told him, how monarch butterflies migrate to Central America and opened the world of Science, to a boy who was so eager about his collections. It became a turning point in his life.</p>
<p>How did his mother help him?</p>
<p>His mother had always encouraged his interest in learning. She took him on trips, bought him telescopes, microscopes, cameras mounting materials and other equipment and helped him in many other ways.</p> 
<p>What lesson does Ebright learn when he does not win anything at a science fair?</p>
<p>The lesson that Ebright learnt was that his entry was slides of frog tissues which he showed under a microscope and the winners had tried to do real experiments. This made him to realize that if he wants to win he has to present real experiments.</p>
<p>What experiments and projects does he then undertake?</p>
<p>Ebright tried to find the cause of a viral disease that kills all monarch caterpillars every few years by raising caterpillars in the presence of beetles.</p>
<p>What are the qualities that go into the making of a scientist?</p>
<p>Richard’s qualities such as his mind of curiosity, his intelligence and the best utilisation of his abilities supported him. He always tried to put extra effort and curiosity in all his works which made him to be successful as a scientist. </p>

<p> ‘What kind of a person is Mme Loisel – Why is she always unhappy?</p>
<p>Mme Loisel is one of the pretty young ladies, born as if through an error of destiny, into a family of clerks. She is always unhappy because she had no dowry, no hopes, no means of becoming known, loved and got married with a petty clerk in the board of Education, which helped her only to lead a simple life.</p>
<p>What kind of a person is her husband?</p>
<p>Her husband is a man of contentment with his simple life and what he had. He never had complained about anything and even a normal meal, he used to consider as delightful feast.</p>
<p>What fresh problem now disturbs Mme Loisel?</p>
<p>Even though her husband was able to arrange dress for Mme Loisel to wear on the day of the Ball, she was disturbed as she was not having a jewellery to wear with it.</p>
<p>How is the problem solved?</p>
<p>The problem is solved through an advice given by her husband to borrow the jewellery from Mme Forestier, her rich friend and neighbour.</p>
<p>What do M. and Mme Loisel do next?</p>
<p>They became sad and began to look for the necklace in the folds of the dress, folds of the cloak, in the pockets and everywhere around. M Loisel went to the police and to the cab offices and put an advertisement in the newspapers, offering a reward.</p>
<p>How do they replace the necklace?</p>
<p>In a shop of the Palais Royal, they found a chaplet of diamond which seemed to them exactly like the one they had lost which was valued at forty thousand francs and bargained at thirty-six thousand. Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left for him and borrowed the rest making ruinous promises, took money from usurers and the whole race of lenders and bought the necklace to replace the necklace. </p>

<p>The course of the Loisel’s life changed due to the necklace. Comment.</p>
<p> OR </p>
<p>What was the cause of Matilda’s ruin? How could she have avoided it?</p>

<p>The story ‘Necklace’ speaks about the result of discontentment of people in their lives. Mme Loisel, a pretty young lady, born as if through an error of destiny, into a family of clerks but she remained unhappy as she had no dowry, no hopes, no means of becoming known, loved and got married with a petty clerk in the board of Education, which helped her only to lead a simple life. Her husband, on the contrary, a man of contentment with his simple life with what he had. He never had complained about anything and even a normal meal, he used to consider as delightful feast. The envelope which was brought by her husband on an evening to invite them for a Ball party brought a drastic change in their life. It was a party where rich sophisticated people will take part. Mme Loisel was not having proper dress and jewellery.  Even though her husband was able to arrange dress for Mme Loisel to wear on the day of the Ball, she was disturbed as she was not having a jewellery to wear with it. The problem is solved through an advice given by her husband to borrow the jewellery from Mme Forestier, her friend and neighbour, who was rich. Unfortunately, the diamond necklace borrowed by Mme Loisel from Mme Forestier missed somewhere. They became sad and began to look for the necklace in the folds of the dress, folds of the cloak, in the pockets and everywhere around. M Loisel went to the police and to the cab offices and put an advertisement in the newspapers, offering a reward. There was no sign of the necklace getting back finally, in a shop of the Palais Royal, they found a chaplet of diamond which seemed to them exactly like the one they had lost which was valued at forty thousand francs and bargained at thirty-six thousand. Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left for him and borrowed the rest making ruinous promises, took money from usurers and the whole race of lenders and bought it to replace the necklace. This has brought them under great debt. They have left all the comforts in life and began to focus only how to pay back.</p>

<p>What would have happened to Matilda if she had confessed to her friend that she had lost her necklace?</p>
