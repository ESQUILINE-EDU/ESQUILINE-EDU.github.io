              <h4> JAMES HERRIOT </h4>
              <p><em> About the Author:-James Albert Wight (3rd October 1916-23rd February 1995), best known by his pen name James Herriot, was a British Veterinary Surgeon and writer. He was famous in writing a series of eight books set in 1930s to 1950s about the animals and their owners and the first publication was in 1970.</em></p>

              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5>James Herriot, narrates his experience with Tricki, a dog, one of his patients and his mistress Mrs Pumphrey. As he was passing on the way, he happened to meet Mrs Pumphrey with tricki. He was worried to see Tricki who became fat, like a bloated sausage with leg at each corner. Mrs Pumphrey explained in a hurry that she found him weak with no energy and felt as suffering from loss of nutritious food. So, she began to give extra food to him extra food like some malt, cod-liver oil and a bowl of Horlicks at night to make him sleep. She continued saying that she couldn’t cut sweets from his diet as he likes cream cakes and chocolates. The doctor found that Tricki became greedy was ready to eat a meal at any time of the day. Mrs Pumphrey had given him a little walk and not much exercise was possible. Within few days Mr Herriot received a call from Mrs Pumphrey with a complaint that Tricki lost his interest even in his favourite in his food and a sensation of vomiting began to express. He spent all his time lying on a rug trying to get breath without moving and doing nothing. The doctor decided to get Tricki out of the house to save him and suggested to hospitalise him. Mrs Pumphrey was almost sad that she knew that Tricki can’t survive without seeing her and at the same time she has realised that he would die if the treatment is not given. Mr Herriot who was strongly determined have taken Tricki and walked towards his car. There was an expression of affection that the entire staff with Mrs Pumphrey, began to run with tricki’s day bed, night bed, favourite cushions, toys breakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl and many more things. Mr Herriot realised that there is not having sufficient space for all the stuff in his car and he started it. While moving he found that all of them were in tears and Tricki, sitting by the side, had wagged his tail. Mr Herriot had determined that he would cure the dog.
In the hospital all the other dogs admitted there gathered around but Tricki’s reaction was dull and they left the place considering him uninteresting. Mr Herriot arranged a place for Tricki and for the first two days, he did not give any food to him and allowed to drink plenty of water. By evening of the second day he began to react and on the third day he started to create a painful sound for the sounds of the dogs in the yard. Slowly he began to mingle with other dogs enjoying food and play games. Since then his health began to get improve. 
Mrs Pumphrey kept on getting information about the improvement of Tricki and when she came to know that he is out of danger, she started to bring fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up Tricki’s strength, followed by bottles of wine and brandy. The doctor and his partners had a happy time by consuming them with the egg in the morning, wine in the afternoon and brandy at night around bonfire. The doctor felt to keep the dog for a long time but he has informed Mrs Pumphrey that Tricki is alright and she can pick him from the hospital. In two weeks, he had become a strong muscled animal. When Tricki saw his mistress, he was so excited and jumped over her. Mrs Pumphrey said that it is the success of a doctor over a diseased patient.</h5>

              <h4> Questions and Answers </h4>
              <p> 1 What kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary surgeon is? Would you say he was tactful as well as full of common sense? </p>
<p> Mr Herriot, the narrator was a sensible person who could understand his patients at one stroke. He was tactful because very easily he was able to understand that Tricki is in a dangerous condition. He was a person with full of common sense because he has given his full patience and attention to Tricki to bring him to normal condition.</p>
<p>2   Do you think Tricki was happy to go home? What do you think will happen now?</p>
<p>Yes, Tricki was happy to go home. I think Mrs Pumphrey will understand her mistake of overfeeding to Tricki and take care for not to create same diseased condition for Tricki.</p>
<p>3 Do you think this is a real-life episode or mere fiction? Or is it a mixture of both?</p>
<p>‘A Triumph of Surgery’ is written in first person narration to show it as a real-life experience. It can be a mixture of both where it says that Mrs Pumphrey had sent eatables and alcohol to her pet which were enjoyed by the doctor and his partners. </p>

<h4>Think About It.</h4>

<p>“Griffin was rather a lawless person.” Comment.</p>
<p>Griffin was a brilliant scientist, who had successfully invented the medicine to turn objects with mass to be transparent. He was brilliant in using his intelligence but his behaviour of lawlessness made him to turn into a negative character. The best example is his attitude towards his landlord. His landlord disliked him and tried to eject him. As a part of taking revenge upon him, Griffin set fire to the house and ran away from there. He had removed his clothes to get away without being seen. His act of lawlessness brought him to be without clothes, without money and quite invisible. His abilities and intelligence which could have been used for the prosperity of society and country had become meaningless and a matter of inconvenience for himself because of his lawlessness.</p>
<p>How would you assess Griffin as a Scientist?</p>

<p>9 Why did Bholi at first agree to an unequal match? Why did she later reject the marriage? What does this tell us about her?</p>
<p>Bholi agreed to an unequal match at first because she wanted to honour and respect her father’s dignity. She later rejected the marriage because Bishember Nath had demanded for five thousand rupees as dowry, when he saw pock-marks on her face.

              <h5>The story Letter to God revolves around the idea of a farmer, having unquestionable faith on God. Lencho the farmer was completely in confidence of God that he may get help from God. It was an unexpected situation that arose in the life of Lencho and his family. They were expecting to have a downpour of rain for a good harvest. The sudden change of wind and hailstorm had completely spoiled their expectations and all their crops. Lencho and family began to look forward for the help from God. Being a hardworking man, like an ox, had decided to write a letter to God. 
The following Sunday morning, Lencho had written a letter to God, saying that he is in need of God’s help. If he and his family will go hungry, unless there comes help from God. He had posted the letter in the post office with an address to ‘GOD”. The post man began to laugh by seeing the address. The postmaster, even though joined the laughter of the post man, suddenly stopped his laughter thinking about the height of Lencho’s faith in God. He had asked all his employees to help to keep the faith of the man up. He asked for money from his employees, he himself gave a part of his salary and several friends of his were obliged to give something for an act of charity. Even though he had tried all his ways to collect money as an act of charity, he couldn’t collect hundred pesos according to the requirement of Lencho. He had inserted all the money that is collected in an envelope, with an address, from ‘GOD’.
The following Sunday Lencho came, in search of a reply from God and the postmaster, with the satisfaction of doing something good for a needy person, handed over the envelope to Lencho. He had opened the envelope and found that there were only seventy pesos. He began to think that God can not do this to him and the postoffice employees might have taken the money from that. He had started to write another letter, mentioning that he hadn’t got enough money so God has to sent remaining also but not through the post office because the people in post office are not trustworthy.

The way Lencho feels sadness and grief, after the storm appropriately projects the conflict of the nature and the man. In the later part of the story, the post master with the help of his employees collected seventy pesos as the possible amount by them, in order to not to shake the faith of Lencho but when Lencho blames post office people for stealing part of the money it turns to the conflict between humans. The post office employees including Post master have been mistaken by Lencho due to his strong faith in God.</p>
