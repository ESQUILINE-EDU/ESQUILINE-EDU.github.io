              <h4> JAMES HERRIOT </h4>
              <p><em> About the Author:-James Albert Wight (3rd October 1916-23rd February 1995), best known by his pen name James Herriot, was a British Veterinary Surgeon and writer. He was famous in writing a series of eight books set in 1930s to 1950s about the animals and their owners and the first publication was in 1970.</em></p>

            <h3 class="resume-title">SUMMARY</h3>
              <div class="resume-item">
     
              <h5>James Herriot, narrates his experience with Tricki, a dog, one of his patients and his mistress Mrs Pumphrey. As he was passing on the way, he happened to meet Mrs Pumphrey with tricki. He was worried to see Tricki who became fat, like a bloated sausage with leg at each corner. Mrs Pumphrey explained in a hurry that she found him weak with no energy and felt as suffering from loss of nutritious food. So, she began to give extra food to him extra food like some malt, cod-liver oil and a bowl of Horlicks at night to make him sleep. She continued saying that she couldn’t cut sweets from his diet as he likes cream cakes and chocolates. The doctor found that Tricki became greedy was ready to eat a meal at any time of the day. Mrs Pumphrey had given him a little walk and not much exercise was possible. Within few days Mr Herriot received a call from Mrs Pumphrey with a complaint that Tricki lost his interest even in his favourite in his food and a sensation of vomiting began to express. He spent all his time lying on a rug trying to get breath without moving and doing nothing. The doctor decided to get Tricki out of the house to save him and suggested to hospitalise him. Mrs Pumphrey was almost sad that she knew that Tricki can’t survive without seeing her and at the same time she has realised that he would die if the treatment is not given. Mr Herriot who was strongly determined have taken Tricki and walked towards his car. There was an expression of affection that the entire staff with Mrs Pumphrey, began to run with tricki’s day bed, night bed, favourite cushions, toys breakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl and many more things. Mr Herriot realised that there is not having sufficient space for all the stuff in his car and he started it. While moving he found that all of them were in tears and Tricki, sitting by the side, had wagged his tail. Mr Herriot had determined that he would cure the dog.
In the hospital all the other dogs admitted there gathered around but Tricki’s reaction was dull and they left the place considering him uninteresting. Mr Herriot arranged a place for Tricki and for the first two days, he did not give any food to him and allowed to drink plenty of water. By evening of the second day he began to react and on the third day he started to create a painful sound for the sounds of the dogs in the yard. Slowly he began to mingle with other dogs enjoying food and play games. Since then his health began to get improve. 
Mrs Pumphrey kept on getting information about the improvement of Tricki and when she came to know that he is out of danger, she started to bring fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up Tricki’s strength, followed by bottles of wine and brandy. The doctor and his partners had a happy time by consuming them with the egg in the morning, wine in the afternoon and brandy at night around bonfire. The doctor felt to keep the dog for a long time but he has informed Mrs Pumphrey that Tricki is alright and she can pick him from the hospital. In two weeks, he had become a strong muscled animal. When Tricki saw his mistress, he was so excited and jumped over her. Mrs Pumphrey said that it is the success of a doctor over a diseased patient.</h5>

              <h4> Questions and Answers </h4>
              <p> 1 What kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary surgeon is? Would you say he was tactful as well as full of common sense? </p>
<p> Mr Herriot, the narrator was a sensible person who could understand his patients at one stroke. He was tactful because very easily he was able to understand that Tricki is in a dangerous condition. He was a person with full of common sense because he has given his full patience and attention to Tricki to bring him to normal condition.</p>
<p>2   Do you think Tricki was happy to go home? What do you think will happen now?</p>
<p>Yes, Tricki was happy to go home. I think Mrs Pumphrey will understand her mistake of overfeeding to Tricki and take care for not to create same diseased condition for Tricki.</p>
<p>3 Do you think this is a real-life episode or mere fiction? Or is it a mixture of both?</p>
<p>‘A Triumph of Surgery’ is written in first person narration to show it as a real-life experience. It can be a mixture of both where it says that Mrs Pumphrey had sent eatables and alcohol to her pet which were enjoyed by the doctor and his partners. </p>

<h4>Think About It.</h4>

<p>“Griffin was rather a lawless person.” Comment.</p>
<p>Griffin was a brilliant scientist, who had successfully invented the medicine to turn objects with mass to be transparent. He was brilliant in using his intelligence but his behaviour of lawlessness made him to turn into a negative character. The best example is his attitude towards his landlord. His landlord disliked him and tried to eject him. As a part of taking revenge upon him, Griffin set fire to the house and ran away from there. He had removed his clothes to get away without being seen. His act of lawlessness brought him to be without clothes, without money and quite invisible. His abilities and intelligence which could have been used for the prosperity of society and country had become meaningless and a matter of inconvenience for himself because of his lawlessness.</p>
<p>How would you assess Griffin as a Scientist?</p>

If he would have been used his invention for a good cause, it would have helped for the development of technology.</p>

              <h4> Questions and Answers </h4>
           
<p> 1 Why is Bholi’s father worried about her?</p>
<p>Bholi’s father is worried about her because she had neither good looks nor intelligence as a result that she had fallen off the cot on her head and had damaged some part of her brain and her entire body was permanently disfigured by deep black pock, due to an attack of small-pox.
<p>2 For what unusual reasons is Bholi sent to school?</p>

<p>4 Does she find her teacher different from the people at home?</p>

<p>5 Why do Bholi’s parents accept Bishamber’s marriage proposal?</p>

<p>The marriage does not take place because Bishember Nath insisted Numberdar Ramlal, Bholi’s father, for five thousand rupees as Bishember Nath found that her face is full of pock marks.</p>
<p>7 Bholi had many apprehensions about going to school. What made her feel that she was going to a better place than home?</p>
<p>On the first day in which Bholi was going to school, she was bathed, oil was rubbed into her dry and matted hair and an old, clean dress of Champa was given to her. So, she felt that she was going to a better place than home.</p>

 <p>Bholi’s teacher played an important role in changing the course of her life as she found her teacher different from the people at home. According to her, teacher’s voice was so soft and soothing and in all her life she had never been called Bholi and the teacher’s attitude touched her heart.</p>
<p>9 Why did Bholi at first agree to an unequal match? Why did she later reject the marriage? What does this tell us about her?</p>
<p>Bholi agreed to an unequal match at first because she wanted to honour and respect her father’s dignity. She later rejected the marriage because Bishember Nath had demanded for five thousand rupees as dowry, when he saw pock-marks on her face. This tells that the education gave the power of self - reliance and courage to Bholi to speak against the injustice that may have taken place towards her and her family. </p>
